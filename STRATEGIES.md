## ✅ Working strategies (net Sharpe > 1)

The core finding of the repo: **the change in 2Y rate differential predicts next-day FX**, generalises across G10, and survives as a portfolio.

## ❌ Failed / rejected / inconclusive

| # | Strategy | Net Sharpe | Why it failed |
|---|---|---|---|
| **7** | USDCHF rate-diff | 0.00 | SNB peg break 2015 + safe-haven flows override rates |
| **11 ❌** | Cross-sectional momentum portfolio (rejected) | −0.34 | Post-GFC FX momentum decay; confirmed at 21/63/126/252 lookbacks |
| **13 ⚠** | CFTC positioning ±2σ + 21-DMA reversal (long+short) | −0.07 | Asymmetric: short 40% win ✓, long 30% win ✗ |
| **9** | USDNOK rate-diff (deferred) | — | TVC has no NO 2Y data; deferred to Norges Bank API |
| **Tech sweep ⚠** | 15 classic technical indicators × 3 majors | best +0.14 | None deployable; consistent with Park-Irwin 2007 |
| **15** ❌ | EURUSD SMA20 + RSI(14) combo (long-only) | −0.34 | 49 trades, 24.5% win rate. Classic confluence doesn't work on liquid EURUSD |
| **16** ❌ | VIX spike → safe-haven short (USDJPY + USDCHF) | −0.39 | Safe-haven thesis empirically broken in JPY carry-trade era + post-SNB CHF |
| **17** ⚠ | Oil (WTI) → next-day USDCAD (timing artefact) | 3.96 → ⚠ | Verified by #19: collapses to −0.84 with 1-day extra lag. Captures intraday WTI-USDCAD response in Yahoo close-time gap. Not tradable real-time. |
| **19** ✓ | Oil → USDCAD with 1-day lag (rigour check) | −0.84 | Verification of #17 — confirms it was timing artefact. Signal correlation collapses from −0.16 to ~0. |

## 🔬 Supporting analyses (diagnostics & rigour checks)

| Artefact | What it shows | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Signal-IC regression** (`notebooks/regression_all_pairs.py`) | β, R², t-stat per pair for next-day FX ~ Δrate-diff | All 8 βs positive, t-stats 6.3 – 17.5 |
| **Sub-period stability** (`notebooks/subperiod_stability.py`) | Sharpe across ZIRP/Divergence/COVID/Hiking regimes | Signal strongest when rates are most active |
| **Momentum lookback sweep** (`notebooks/explore_momentum_lookbacks.py`) | Cross-sectional MOM at 21/63/126/252 days | Negative at every horizon |
| **2Y diff scatter** (`notebooks/explore_2y_diff_vs_eurusd.py`) | EURUSD: β = +0.0335, R² = 7.5% | Strong, UIP-consistent |

## What the research narrative shows

| Layer | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **A real factor exists** | Strategies #1–#10: rate-diff signal works on 7 of 8 G10 pairs, generalises into portfolio |
| **It's regime-robust** | Sub-period analysis shows positive in all four macro regimes (ZIRP / divergence / COVID / hiking) |
| **It's correctly calibrated** | Strategy #12 fixes leverage to hit 10% vol target without changing Sharpe |
| **Failures are documented honestly** | Momentum, positioning (long side), classic TA, trend-confirmation overlay — all tested, all rejected/degraded with literature-citation context |
| **Results are auditable** | 6 daily-frequency CSVs let any reviewer recompute the headline numbers |

- **Verification**: any CSV in [`live/track_record/`](live/track_record/) — open in any spreadsheet, recompute the metrics yourself
- **Reproducing**: each strategy has a standalone script in [`strategies/`](strategies/). Requires `FRED_API_KEY` for Strategy #1; rest use cached TVC yields.

## Stack

- **Python**: pandas, numpy, scipy, statsmodels, matplotlib
- **Backtesting**: bespoke walk-forward + event-driven engines (no `backtrader` / `vectorbt` dependency for the published strategies)
- **Cost model**: 5 pips round-trip (2.5 pips per unit of position turnover), pip-size aware per pair (JPY = 0.01)

## Strategy #20 — Classical vol-normalised carry (G10, monthly rebalance)

**Explanation.** Each month-end, computes the vol-normalised carry score for each G10 pair as `(base 2Y rate − quote 2Y rate) / 30-day realised FX vol`. Ranks all 7 G10 pairs by this score, goes long the top-2 (highest vol-adjusted carry — the "best risk-adjusted yielders") and short the bottom-2 (lowest, typically the lowest-yielders). Each position is sized at 1/4 of capital, so total gross exposure is 100% (50% long / 50% short, dollar-neutral). Holds positions for one month, then re-ranks at the next month-end. This is the **classical level-based carry** signal — fundamentally different from our `d_diff`-based strategies (#1, #18) which use the *change* in rate differential.

**Result** (2010–2024, monthly, net of 5 pips RT cost):
Net Sharpe **0.07**, annual return **+0.44%**, max DD **−20.85%**, monthly skew **−0.07** (does NOT confirm Dupuy's +0.97 positive-skew claim for the pre-2020 era). The result confirms the post-2008 carry decay documented in the literature ("Benchmark carry SR ~0.06 post-2008 vs ~0.76 pre-crisis") and demonstrates *why* our change-based `d_diff` approach (Strategy #18 Sharpe 2.90 net) dominates the classical level-based carry on the same 2010–2024 universe.
